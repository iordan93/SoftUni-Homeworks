* Java
Java is very similar to C#. It has most of its features, although some of them have different names. There are some things that Java misses from C#, for example, it does not have a type similar to decimal in C#. Also, it does not support structs (value types) like C#.

* PHP
PHP is quite different from C#. First of all, it is interpreted. This means there is no compilation like in C#, the scripts are evaluated on the go. Second, it's a dynamically typed language. The variables don't have types (like int, double, or string).

* Python
Like PHP, Python is also dynamically typed. It has quite a different syntax. In Python there are no curly braces ("{", "}"), no semicolons (";"), and the indentation of the lines of code matters. It is also a bit slower than C# because it is interpreted like PHP.

* Visual Basic .NET
Visual Basic .NET is very similar to C#. After compilation, both C# and Visual Basic .NET are compiled to the same intermediate language. The main difference between the two languages is in the syntax. Visual Basic .NET has a syntax similar to that of Python.

* JavaScript
JavaScript is not similar to Java in any way (except its name). It is very different than C#. It is interpreted and dynamic, like PHP and Python, but unlike PHP and Python (also unlike C#) it isn't object oriented. JavaScript was made for procedural programming only but there are many hacks pprogrammers use to make it work for nearly everything.
