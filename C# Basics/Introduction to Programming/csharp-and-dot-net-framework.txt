C# is one of the languages in .NET Framework. Other languages include Visual Basic .NET and F#. The .NET Framework also includes many technologies, such as LINQ and ASP.NET. 
The basic workflow goes like this: a C# project is compiled to IL (Intermediate Language). Then, the .NET Framework translates the IL into machine language and passes it to the operating system.
